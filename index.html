        <p> My favorite hobby is reading. I love it when I can find a good book to read. I also really like book series like Harry Potter, I have read the entire series more than once. I know reading is also a good hobby, it makes your grammer better for sure and you learn new words. Its amazing how you can get so lost in a really good book or novel. I like many genres too. My favorite are Fantasy and mystery. Though I can read a lot of different genres. I like books on road trips the most. When you get bored you can read and time will pass by easily. It also keeps me busy for a while wich I like to be. Reading books also helps you visualise things more easily. When you are reading a book with no pictures and the author is describing a character to you, you will need to viualise what that character looks like based off of the description. That is the reason I like to read and why it is my favorite hobby.</p>
